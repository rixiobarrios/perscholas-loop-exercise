# Loop Exercise

    1: initialize the variable i to 1


    2: checks if i (1) is less than or equal to 3 (true)


    3: initialize the variable str as a blank string


    4: initialize the variable j to 1


    5: checks if j (1) is less than or equal to i (1) (true)


    6: concatenates 1 as a string to the variable str ("1")


    7: increment j by 1 (2)


    8: checks if j (2) is less than or equal to i (1) (false)


    9: print str variable ("1")


    10: increment i by 1 (2)


    11: checks if i (2) is less than or equal to 3 (true)


    12: initialize the variable str as a blank string


    13: initializes j to 1


    14: checks if j (1) is less than or equal to i (2) (true)


    15: concatenates 1 as a string to the variable str ("1")
